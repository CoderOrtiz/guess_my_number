# The Guess My Number Game
Working with the Document Object Model (DOM) and Events

## Description:

Welcome to the "Guess My Number Game"! While I have experience with the DOM, this was a fun project that pushed and reinforced what I have known and have learned. In the "Guess My Number" project the User is prompted to "start guessing" numbers between 1-20. The secret number is a pseudo-random generated number. A box is provided for the User to enter a number of their choosing. Provided within the box is up and down arrows if the User choses to utilize them. Once they have chosen the number, they must press the "Check" button to see if they guessed the right number. If the User did, then the webpage turns a light green, a message displays stating, "You Won", and the "?" displayed will now display the secret number. The first score saved will be saved as a high score, which will be compared for later rounds, and if higher, will be saved as the new high score. When the User is ready to try again, in the top left-hand corner is the "Try Again" button, which will reset the page as the user originally found it, except, the high score will be saved, and your last number chosen, will remain in the box. If the user does not enter a number in the box at any time during the game, they will be prompted, "Please select a number between 1-20".
 
## Topics Covered within This Project:

1. Reviewing what is the Document Object Model (DOM) and how to manipulate the DOM.

2. How to select elements, ID's and Classes and how to manipulate them, as well as manipulating CSS.

3. Reviewing and adding Click Events.

4. Adding Game Logic using If Else Statements.

5. Improving my Refactoring Skills within the JavaScript File.

## How I Did, What I Changed, and my Final Thoughts:

The way I tackled this project was by watching all of the lessons, digesting any new material, and then I took a break. I returned later and began to code from what I could remember, not to be confused with memorizing. For the most part, the project went pretty smoothly, there were a couple of times I got legitimately stuck and went back to the material for a "sneak peak", often just an oh yeah moment. I am unsure how much my code does or does not resemble the code from Jonas, as I have not reviewed his finished code.

What two main things I did differently was that I altered the provided CSS file and moved "<'Between 1 and 20'>" to underneath the "Guess My Number" as well as made the game usable on smart devices as I know my friends and family wonâ€™t use my game on their desktops. This was a revisit to CSS and brought back fun memories of making my own webpages and websites. I also added an Easter Egg for my closest friends and provided them a riddle to see if they could figure out my challenge for them.

My final thoughts are that I had a blast putting this game together and the end result was truly fulfilling! This was great practice for manipulating items using the DOM and I learned a lot from Jonas when it comes to Refactoring JavaScript code. I am thankful he went over how to Refactor because I was able to considerably reduce my wet code and produce DRY code. I think the biggest take away from this project was the refactoring. I am very excited for the next project! See you on the next one ðŸ™‚
